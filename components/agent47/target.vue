            Become the Master Assassin. As Agent 47, you perform contract hits on powerful, high-profile targets in exotic locations around the world. Where to go, when to strike and who to kill – it is all up to you.

            As you master each mission, you’ll complete challenges and earn XP that will award new suits, weapons, items and gadgets to give you an edge when you replay missions. Gain a tactical advantage by starting a mission from a new vantage point or have your Agency stash items for you. </p>
